Maybe Jump
==========

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows you to configure on which sides the thumbstick will be  used as jump.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [MaybeJump.dll](https://github.com/Ryn-Fox/ResoniteMaybeJump/releases/download/v1.1.0r/MaybeJump.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
4. (Optional) Use [ResoniteModSettings](https://github.com/badhaloninja/ResoniteModSettings) to configure your thumbstick settings on the fly (respawn after saving changes).
